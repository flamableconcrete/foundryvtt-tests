# fvtt-markers
A simple module that contains markers (1-100, A-Z, a-z, and some symbols) for a DM to use to mark their maps.

Big thanks to Paul Umber's article on [Building Compendia for Foundry VTT](https://pumbers.github.io/game-manglement/articles/vtt_compendia_building/) so I didn't have to do most of my editing through Foundry itself.
